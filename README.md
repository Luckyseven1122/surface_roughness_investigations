# Surface roughness investigations with deep learning technology

This is a projects which aims to monitor surface roughness of workpiece by machining signal

## Current step

+ build a high-accurate monitoring model 
![Loss curve in training](./loss_curve.jpg)
![Comparison between real and predicted value](./RESULT.svg)

## What we will do in the future

+ build a valid GAN model to simulate machining process
+ find the optimize machining parameters by search the tensor space of G network
